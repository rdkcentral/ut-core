# Contributing

This sourcetree is a POC at the moment, and will migrate to rdkcentral codespace in GitHub, there is no requirement from development point of view to have multiple git repo's. As part of the POC a single source of truth is now possible, due to the versioning of the interfaces.

Each of the hals will be split into separate git repo's and these will be controlled with documentation, doxygen commands, and tests released against a fixed version.
