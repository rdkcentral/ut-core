# RDK-B Wifi HAL Testing Specification

# History

|Version|Date (YY-MM-DD)|Author|

Version format to be defined. Proposal: Major.Minor.Doc

The version should increment with:

  * Doc: A change in the documentation. Since the documentation defines sematic operation, it is important as an interface header definition change. It is backward compatible because it does not change the ABI.

  * Minor: A backward compatible change to the API. Defined as no change to the ABI exposed by the library that is used by the client.

  * Major: A non-backward compatible change to the API.

A version history should always be provide to track the evolution of the
Component interface.
